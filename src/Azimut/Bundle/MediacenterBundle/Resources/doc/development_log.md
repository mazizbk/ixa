YLC. Begining the developement with raw javascript
--------------------------------------------------

The code has to be more explicit and more organised to be maintenable => searching for a correct object pattern in JS


YLC. Developing a solution with object pattern
----------------------------------------------

The code is more legible, but js has a limitation because of the 'this' context. The code is becoming complex to follow because the context has to be injected as parameter all the time


YLC. Starting research for a js framework
-----------------------------------------

Backbone seems to be a confortable way to structure the js code
=> begin implÃ©mentation of the mediacenter js code into backbone

Facing integration problems, starting to look at other frameworks : ember.js, angularJS, ...

After testing, angularJS seems easier to use in our context

In the mean time, problems with Bonebone has been solved, but there is more to do with Backbone :
 - the model has to be explicitely declared (leads to code the entities twice)
 - data binding has to be done by hand

AngularJS directly use the JSON fetched from the server as the model. Data binding is implicit and easy to understand.


Developping an AngularJS demo for the mediacenter structure management (outside of symfony)


YLC. Dropping Backbone, hello Angular
-------------------------------------

The AngularJS experimentation is running well. Begining integration into symfony project instead of Backbone.


24/06/2013 - YLC - Switching API from custom made to FOSRestBundle
------------------------------------------------------------------

Because FOSRestBundle has many automations for building API.
Using Nelmio API Doc Bundle to manage documentation and tests

FOSJSRoutingBundle with FOSRestBundle : while the routes names are autogenerated, we can't add the "expose" option. Instead I use "name_prefix" (in routing_api.yml) to prefix all the mediacenter api routes names in symfony with "azimut_mediacenter_api_".
To enable name_prefix, "type:rest" had to be added in app/routing.yml when calling routing_api.yml from the bundle.
Then, to tell FOSJSRoutingBundle to expose all of these routes, I added this code in app/config.yml:

	fos_js_routing:
	    routes_to_expose:
	        - "^azimut_mediacenter_api_.*"

2013/10/24 - YLC - experiencing problems with behat tests and selenium
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When trying to execute a test like:
	$this->getSession()->wait($seconds*1000);
Then having error : waiting for evaluate.js load failed

I finaly switched from selenium 2.33 to 2.37 and it solved the issue


2013/12/05 - YLC - linking medias from mediacenter with other bundles
---------------------------------------------------------------------

First solution was to make MediaDeclinationAttachment entity a mapped superclass so other bundles can extend it and inject they relations.
But it the end the problem was : from a mediadeclination we cannot fetch all objects that have a link to a media declination because they are not all of the same class.

Here comes the second solution : MediaDeclinationAttachment is now a classic entity linked to mediaDeclination and to MediaAttachedBaseObject.
MediaAttachedBaseObject is a mapped superclass, that has to be extended in other bundles to set the linkage without having to redeclare it. Now we have only one base class to link to.
But One-To-Many associations are not possible on a mapped superclass at all. Many-To-Many associations are only possible if the mapped superclass is only used in exactly one entity at the moment.

So gone back to the first solution for the moment !
